Dimensional Dream is a boss-focused mod that adds characters and patterns from the Touhou Project series. All characters belong to Team Shanghai Alice.
This mod is current in alpha. Bugs will happen, so please report any you come across.

To summon Orin, use 5 rotten chunks, 10 purification powder, 10 wood and a tombstone.

To summon Rin Kaenbyou, use 5 ectoplasm, 10 purification powder, 10 wood and a tombstone.

VERSION v0.3.0:
-- Rebalanced previous bosses.

-- Added Rin Kaenbyou (post-plantera boss).
-- Added 7 drops between the two bosses.
