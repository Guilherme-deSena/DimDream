Dimensional Dream is a boss-focused mod that adds characters and patterns from the Touhou Project series. All characters belong to Team Shanghai Alice.
This mod is current in alpha. Bugs will happen, so please report any you come across.

To summon Chiyuri, use 10 palladium or cobalt bars and 5 souls of light in an anvil to craft her summon item.
To summon Yumemi, craft a pocket collider with 10 meteorite bars, 5 souls of sight and 3 fallen stars.

VERSION v0.2.1:
-- Miniature Hypervessel no longer needs hallowed bars to be crafted, and thus, Chiyuri can be spawned earlier in Hardmode.
-- Reduced cooldown between Chiyuri's patterns.
-- Raised both bosses' health in difficulties starting from Expert.

VERSION v0.2.0:
-- Added Yumemi Okazaki, her summon item and treasure bag.
-- Added Chiyuri's treasure bag.
-- Added 6 weapon drops to the treasure bags (4 in Yumemi's, 2 in Chiyuri's).

VERSION v0.1.0:
-- Initial alpha release.
-- Added the boss Chiyuri Kitashiragawa and her summon item, Miniature Hypervessel.
